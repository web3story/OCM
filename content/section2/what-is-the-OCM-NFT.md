What is OnChainMonkey (OCM)?
\
\
OnChainMonkey is an NFT community started by Metagood and the crypto industry veterans Bill Tai, Danny Yang, and Amanda Terry, with the purpose of doing well while doing good.
\
\
Membership in the community is by the Genesis and Karma NFTs.  Genesis is the first on-chain profile picture (PFP) collection created in a single transaction, a world first and historical milestone. Karma is the collection by our award winning art team, who have animated some of Hollywoodâ€™s best movies with long IMDB histories (many movie credits, nominations and wins). 
\
\
Genesis and Karma NFTs will provide membership into the OCM community, governance of the DAO, participation in community projects, VIP talks and in real life events, and the banana token rewards and economy.
\
\
Desserts are NFTs used to create a Karma NFT from your Genesis NFT. Each Genesis can eat one of each type of Dessert. The Desserts are burned and a new Karma is created. There are 3 types of Desserts, so up to 3 Karma can be created from a single Genesis. The Genesis is unchanged, so you would have 4 monkeys if your Genesis eats all 3 Desserts.
