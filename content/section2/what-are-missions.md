Monkeyverse Missions
\
\
Fun never stops with each Mission. Complete a Mission and earn a variety of rewards - from Karma NFTs to mystery prize items used in future Missions.
\
\
Intro to Missions
\
\
The OCM Community is a strong network of fearless and pioneering monkeys who hope for a better future with ideas to share, and want to make our Web3 world better while making a positive real world impact.
\
\
We’re bringing Missions to the Monkeyverse!
\
\
Connect the ideas and stars of our Monkeyverse - from the OCM DAO, Bananas economy, OCM real-life (IRL) events, to Community Projects, OCM Merch Store, and ever-expanding OCM membership benefits. We’re connecting them through Missions to become journeys, stories, and innovations to make impactful real Web3 and world changes together.
\
\
Let’s experiment. Let’s play. Let’s connect and work together in making a difference while earning rewards. You might just discover a surprise, a clue, or two. In fact, our Monkeyverse is just getting started. Look at the time! Let’s go on a Mission!
\
\
What is a Mission?
\
\
Missions are experiments and tasks, ranging from holding your monkey, voting in the OCM DAO, participating in a hackathon, to joining real-life conservation missions and discovering something new on the OCM website. Go on a Mission, and earn rewards.
\
\
Rewards
\
\
Rewards can range from pieces to a puzzle, or even a Karma monkey itself! Rewards from one mission could be used in the next. 
It seems like these monkeys are up to something big … Start your missions!
