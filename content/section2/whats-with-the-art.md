#### Why didn’t you use a better artist to create OnChainMonkey?
\
\
We frequently hear people asking about the aesthetic of OnChainMonkey. They want to know who designed artwork that could seemingly be created in just a few minutes. However, it wasn’t really drawn by an artist at all, and that’s part of what makes it so magical. It was programmed, and I assure you it took quite a bit longer than a few minutes. Our 10,000 unique monkey images were all generated by a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. This has a high level of programming complexity, and means the art itself will have a simpler look and feel to it.

#### On Chain vs. Off Chain
\
\
There is no JPEG image file of an OnChainMonkey needed anywhere. The monkey images were programmed and are dynamically generated by the smart contract. Said differently, we coded OnChainMonkey into existence instead of designing an image and uploading it to the blockchain. Images created in this way are known as on chain art. On chain art is challenging to do, but they have a very special quality: like the Lascaux cave drawings, they will survive a long time, as long as the blockchain survives.
\
\
Conversely, when something is created off chain, the blockchain is the medium where it is traded, but the digital file lives on a separate file system like Amazon Web Services or IPFS. This poses some level of risk, as it means there’s a chance that the NFT file could go away if the service storing it goes down or the project stops paying their bills. But again, when something is generated and lives on chain, it’s not going anywhere…at least as long as the decentralized blockchain exists.
\
\
There were already on chain projects, and we wanted to try something a little different. As many people in the NFT world know, some of the most popular projects right now are profile picture projects (PFPs). However, only a few previous on chain projects are PFPs due to the complexity of creating an interesting collection of profile pictures from code. So we decided to take our shot at bridging those two things together, and even take it one step further. From what we can find, OnChainMonkey was the first PFP collection created all on chain in a single transaction. We’re proud of that.
