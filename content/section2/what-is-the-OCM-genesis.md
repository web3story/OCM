What is Genesis?
\
\
OCM Genesis is a piece of history. It is the first on-chain PFP collection created in a single transaction.
\
\
Genesis is an on-chain NFT collection. This means, Genesis was "drawn" by smart contract code, and all the images and meta-data are on-chain and generated by the smart contract on the fly. Genesis is the first on-chain profile pic (PFP) NFT collection completely created in a single Ethereum transaction.
