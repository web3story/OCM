**What is OCM DAO?**
\
\
The  (“decentralized autonomous organization”) is a community fund that is managed by OCM holders, rather than the Metagood team. The purpose of this fund is to leverage the power of the OCM community to grow and sustain efforts to “do well and do good” in the world. This is monkey business by, and for the monkeys!
\
\
As OCM membership increases in number, value, and representation, the OCM DAO will become more resourced, diversified, and impactful across industries and outcomes.
\
\
When it comes to supporting monkey business, the OCM DAO and Metagood play separate, but complementary roles. The OCM DAO supports grassroots, community-led initiatives that extend the OCM brand into new spheres of influence and push the limits of collective social impact. Metagood also builds the OCM brand, but is focused in areas where a central point of contact is more efficient or secure.
\
\
For example, the DAO may fund a project that extends the OCM brand into the VR/AR/XR space based on the unique talents and interests of token holders. This leverages the strengths of the decentralized community and doesn’t rely on central gatekeepers to source or sustain the idea. Metagood, on the other hand, may fund an IRL event for OCM holders and invite speakers that are part of the company’s investor network. This leverages the position of the company as a central, coordinating figure, and makes the planning process more cohesive and efficient.
\
\
In the early stages there will likely be overlap between the DAO and Metagood’s activities, but in the long term, the hope is that each plays a distinct and differentiated role in building the Monkeyverse.
